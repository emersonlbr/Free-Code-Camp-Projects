# Free-Code-Camp-Projects
this is a simple repository to all my projects on FreeCodeCamp. I use it as backup and to check my progress.
I'm constantly making the apps better, fixing bugs etc, if you find any please open an issue.

Most of them are just Vanilla JS so you can simple download the code and open it on your browser. in each folder there's a 
readme to a live payperview.
